            <h2>Cat Page Content</h2>
            <p>Cats were first domesticated around 7500 BCE in the western Asia region and are currently the second most popular domestic pet in the United States. While there are over 60 unique documented cat breeds, care and diet can differ between breeds.</p>
        
            <h3>Kitten Care Guide</h3>
            <h4>Zero to Four Weeks</h4>
            <p>Kittens should ideally be nursed by their mother, but if not, they may require bottle feeding. Some common reasons kittens might not gain weight include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Too many siblings competing for milk</li>
                <li>Gastrointestinal disease</li>
                <li>Extreme temperatures or unsanitary conditions</li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>Four Weeks to One Year</h4>
            <p>Kittens can begin eating soft wet food around three to four weeks of age. The <a href="https://www.aspca.org/">ASPCA</a> recommends feeding them half to one cup of dry food or six to nine ounces of wet food per day.</p>
        
            <h4>One Year to Seven Years</h4>
            <p>At this stage, cats require structured meal times to prevent obesity. Avoid leaving food out all day and feed them twice daily.</p>
        
            <h4>Seven Years and More</h4>
            <p>Older cats require high-quality proteins and fewer fats. When selecting food, ensure it specifies proteins like "salmon" rather than just general "fish."</p>
